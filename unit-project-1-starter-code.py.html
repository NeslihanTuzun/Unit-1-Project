# # SF-DAT-21 | Unit Project 1
# In this first unit project you will create a framework to scope out data science projects.  This framework will provide you with a guide to develop a well-articulated problem statement and analysis plan that will be robust and reproducible.

# ### Read and evaluate the following problem statement:
# Determine which free-tier customers will covert to paying customers, using demographic data collected at signup (age, gender, location, and profession) and customer useage data (days since last log in, and `activity score 1 = active user`, `0 = inactive user`) based on Hooli data from January - April 2015.

# #### 1. What is the outcome?

# Answer: Paying customer indicator(y/n)

# #### 2. What are the predictors/covariates?

# Answer: Age, gender, location, profession, days since last login and activity score

# #### 3. What timeframe is this data relevent for?

# Answer: January - April 2015

# #### 4. What is the hypothesis?

# Answer: Demographic and customer usage data will allow us to predict if a free-tier customer will convert to paying customer.

# ## Let's get started with our dataset

# In[2]:

import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# If you checked-out the GitHub repository, the UCLA dataset is under ../../dataset/admissions.csv (relative to this file)
path = os.path.join('..', '..', 'dataset', 'admissions.csv')

"""""
# Alternative: Get the dataset directly online...
path = 'http://github.com/ga-students/sf-dat-21/raw/master/unit-projects/dataset/admissions.csv'
"""""

df = pd.read_csv(path)

df.head()


# #### 1. Create a data dictionary.

# Answer: 
# 
# Variable | Description | Type of Variable
# ---|---|---
# Admit | 0 = not admit, 1 = admit | Categorical
# GRE | integer | Continuous
# GPA | integer | Continuous
# Prestige | 1.0- lowest, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0- highest| Categorical

# We would like to explore the association between X and Y.

# #### 2. What is the outcome?

# Answer: admit/not admit
3. What are the predictors/covariates?
# Answer: prestige, gre, gpa

# #### 4. What timeframe is this data relevent for?

# Answer: For the semester

# #### 4. What is the hypothesis?

# Answer: Prestige, GRE and GPA score effect admissions.

# ## Problem Statement

# Using the above information, write a well-formed problem statement.

# Answer: How variables, GRE, GPA and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school.

# ### Exploratory Analysis Plan

# Using the lab from a class as a guide, create an exploratory analysis plan.

# #### 1. What are the goals of the exploratory analysis?

# Answer: 
# maximize insight into a data set;
# uncover underlying structure;
# extract important variables;
# detect outliers and anomalies;
# test underlying assumptions;
# develop parsimonious models; and
# determine optimal factor settings.

# #### 2a. What are the assumptions of the distribution of data?

# Answer: Independence of cases, Normality, Equality
2b. How will determine the distribution of your data?
# Answer: With a p-value test

# #### 3a. How might outliers impact your analysis?

# Answer:  "Unusually" large or small values that are dramatically separated from the rest of the data might be: 'out-of-range' or physically impossible values that resulted from entry or processing error. 

# #### 3b. How will you test for outliers?

# Answer: IQR, where IQR, the ‘Inter Quartile Range’ is the difference between 75th and 25th quartiles. It could be find at the points outside the whiskers in below box plot.

# 4a. What is colinearity?

# Answer: In statistics, collinearityis a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.

# #### 4b. How will you test for colinearity?

# Answer:   Pearson correlation coefficient and  chi-square test.

# #### 5. What is your exploratory analysis plan?
# Using the above information, write an exploratory analysis plan that would allow you or a colleague to reproduce your analysis 1 year from now.

# Answer: Exploratory Analysis - Determine the Distribution - Test for Outliers - Test for Colinearity

# ## Bonus Questions:
# 1. Outline your analysis method for predicting your outcome.
# 2. Write an alternative problem statement for your dataset.
# 3. Articulate the assumptions and risks of the alternative model.
